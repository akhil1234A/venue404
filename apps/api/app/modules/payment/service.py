"""Payment service — Stripe charge/refund logic with race-safe confirmation.

Invariants enforced (see CLAUDE.md):
  * money is integer paise, never float
  * confirmation is transactional with row locks; the booking_slots GIST
    exclusion guarantees only one confirmed booking per slot
  * losing payers are auto-refunded
  * every money movement writes an append-only ledger entry

Commit policy: create_payment_intent / refund_booking are called from request
handlers and commit themselves. confirm_payment / fail_payment are called from
the webhook handler, which owns the commit.

Refund safety: Stripe refund calls are wrapped (a failure records a `failed`
Refund row and never aborts the surrounding confirmation) and are idempotent
(a payment already past `succeeded` is not refunded twice).
